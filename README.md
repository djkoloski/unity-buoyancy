## Buoyancy Algorithm

### Pros
- Easy to implement
- Computationally cheap
- Decent results
- Works with all meshes

### Cons
- Works best with smooth meshes (corners are bad, you may observe the cube and cylinder acting badly)
- Motion seems like it's too fast

### How it works
This uses a finite-element approximation to calculate the buoyant force for an object.

We sum an approximation of the buoyant force across each face for a triangulated mesh using the following calculation:

Let W(x,y) give the height of the water surface at (x,y). In this case, W is a sum of sine waves.

Let P(y) give the pressure at distance y relative to the water surface (negative is underwater).

We will define P(y) as:
```
P(y) = {
  P_0 if y >= 0
  P_0 + p * g * y if y < 0
}
```
where P_0 is standard atmospheric pressure, p is the density of water, and g is gravitational acceleration.

Our algorithm is then:
```
for each face (v_1, v_2, v_3):
  let c = (v_1 + v_2 + v_3) / 3
  let n = (v_2 - v_1) x (v_3 - v_1)
  let normal = n / ||n||
  let a = ||n|| / 2
  let f = -normal * a * P(c_y - W(c_x, c_z))
  apply force f at point c
```
